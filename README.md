# Support-Vector-Machine
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of Support Vector Machines in Python. The code includes functions for data loading, kernel transformation, and the SMO algorithm. It demonstrates the core concepts of SVM, including margin maximization and the kernel trick, without relying on external machine learning libraries.
